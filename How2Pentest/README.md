# How to become a pentester in 12 months

**Disclaimer:** This list is based on my experience and my goals. It's intended to serve as a template and is not a definitive roadmap.

> To become a penetration tester, you need to build a broad technical knowledge and understanding of how systems, networks and applications work and how they can be attacked. \
> A pentest is a targeted security test in which vulnerabilities in a system are found and exploited to simulate real attacks, which are then documented and handed over to the customer.

## What you need to learn to become a pentester

### Fundamentals of IT and network technology
- Operating systems: Windows & Linux (esp. command line, services, user rights)
- Networks: OSI model, TCP/IP, subnetting, DNS, routing, NAT, firewall
- Services & protocols: HTTP(S), FTP, SSH, SMB, DNS, SNMP, etc.

### IT security & types of attack
- Basics of information security (CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Common vulnerabilities: XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, buffer overflows, misconfigurations

### Tools & techniques
- Knowledge of Linux, especially Kali Linux,  Parrot OS or BlackArch
- Tools such as:
	- Nmap (network scanning)
	- Burp Suite (web pentest)
	- Metasploit (exploitation framework)
	- Wireshark (network analysis)
	- Nikto, Gobuster, Hydra, John the Ripper, etc.
- Scripting: Python, Bash, possibly PowerShell

### Programming & Scripting
- Understanding of source code & exploit development
- Languages like:
	- Python (for scripting & automation)
	- JavaScript (for web pentesting)
	- C/C++ or Assembly (for exploit development)
	- SQL (for injections)
	
### Legal & ethics
- You need to know the legal framework (e.g. consent of the target system, GDPR)
- Hacker ethics: "Don't harm. Be responsible."

### Certifications (optional, but helpful)
- CompTIA Security+
- eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester)
- SCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
- Others: PT1, CEH, PNPT, CRTO, TryHackMe Learning Paths

## Steps of a typical penetration test
> A pentest follows a structured process, similar to the Kill-Chain-Model.

### Reconnaissance
- Passive information gathering (Google, Whois, Shodan, DNS, social engineering)
- Active information gathering (ping, portscans, banner grabbing)

### Scanning & Enumeration
- Identify systems and services
- Determine open ports, services, version numbers, user accounts

### Vulnerability Analysis
- Vulnerability analysis with automated tools (e.g. Nessus, OpenVAS)
- Manual detection of vulnerabilities

### Exploitation
- Exploitation of found vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL injection, RCE, privilege escalation)
- Goal: gaining access to systems

### Post-Exploitation
- Analysing what is possible with the compromised system
- Persistence, further privilege escalation, pivoting, data theft

### Reporting
- Clear, comprehensible documentation of the vulnerabilities found
- Risk assessment & recommendations for remediation
- Optional: Presentation to the customer or management
